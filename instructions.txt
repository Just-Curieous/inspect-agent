# TASK: Verify Research Hypotheses

## Context
You are provided with:
- The project’s GitHub repository at `/home/code/`.
- A set of questions and hypotheses with necessary context from the original paper at `/home/paper/`.

You do **not** have access to the full paper — only the repository and extracted questions.

## Objective
Your task is to **implement the necessary code, scripts, and configurations** to verify the hypotheses described in `/home/paper/`.

- Analyze and reuse the code in `/home/code/` where applicable.
- Extend or modify the code as needed to answer the questions and test the hypotheses.
- Prioritize more important hypotheses if time or resources are limited.

Partial credit will be awarded based on:
- How many hypotheses you successfully verify.
- The completeness and correctness of your code.
- The importance of each hypothesis.

## Scope
- Focus **only** on the provided hypotheses and context.
- Ignore unrelated parts of the repository not referenced in `/home/paper/`.
- You may consult external resources for general help (e.g., library documentation), but should not duplicate other people's full solutions.

## Resources
You may also find:
- A `rubric.json` file at `/home/paper/` specifying task breakdowns and priorities.
- An optional `addendum.md` with further clarifications.

## Submission
Submit your work as a Git repository at `/home/submission/`:
- Only include necessary source code, scripts, and configuration files.
- Keep the total committed size under **1GB**.
- Note: any uncommitted files will be deleted before grading.

Also, include a `README.md` that:
- Describes what you accomplished.
- Maps your work to each hypothesis.
- Notes anything incomplete or deviating from the original goals.
